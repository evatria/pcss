We have had a lot of trouble with GitHub. These problems and how we have solved them, will be explained after the documentation on how to download and run the game.

# How to download and play
To download the game simply download the file called "FishRacingBuild"

There has been some problems with a mac build, but if it is for mac, open it in Unity editor and play it there. It work perfectly in the editor.

How to start game:
1. Write your name.

2. Choose to either "Create Server" or "Join Server".

3. To create the server, just press the button. After that you have 30 seconds to join, until the game starts.

4. To join a server, press join server and write the IP of the server. The IP of the server is listed at the top left, on the screen of the host.

5. Start racing when the timer reaches zero.

6. The first one to complete two laps wins.

The game can be controlled on multiple computers, but can only be seen on one screen. This is because no matter what we did, we could not figure out how to send a camera feed back to the client through a string from the server. So it can only be viewed on the host computer screen, who will display all players.

The player can be controlled with WASD or the arrow keys.

Up to four players can join.

Hit the green rotating circles for a boost, but watch out for the fishing rods.

# GitHub troubles
First of all the contributions will not work. Some of the contributers will not even show, even though everyone has contributed, some only shows one contribution, while other contributers has contributed with more than half a million. This is not because everyone has not contributed equaly, because everyone has, and we could not figure out how to fix this problem. We even have the same problem with our P3 repository. 

For the previous reason, we have put what different people have been working on in the wiki.

We also had problems with the ticketing system, as we were not sure how to use it and what to use it for. 

The assignment says to make two repositories, one for the client and one for the server, but we have only made one repository. This reason for this is that we have been making the game in Unity, and the way we have made the game, we could not see how it could be done in two different projects, which is why we have made it in one, and we hope that this is okay.
